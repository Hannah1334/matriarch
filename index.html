<h1>Appearance<br><img style="height:50%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/9JmNFVV.png"/></h1>
While she is pretty average in the topic of feminine attributes, her defined hourglass figure does a fine job proving she's female on its own, and her darker olive-toned complexion adds a nice touch to her tall and athletic frame. Very dark brown--almost black--hair falls down to her mid-back in gentle waves, framing an oval shaped face with delicate features: pronounced cheekbones, a little slightly upturned button nose, full pink lips, and amber eyes that produce an inhuman glow. She's often found wearing pastels and pale colors, making her look a little darker than she really is.
<br><br>
<h1>Carlotta's Personality</h1>
To those whose company she enjoys, she's very charismatic and open minded, often showering her friends and loved ones in affection. She's a good listener but can also speak her own mind if the need arises. To those she doesn't like very much she can be snarky and sassy, using dry humor to get under their skin. Those people aren't very common, though, considering she's quite the people person and generally adores strangers long before they're her friends.
<br><br>
<h1>Bellona's Personality</h1>
Once a happy-go-lucky and free spirit full of so much joy and passion, now only a fraction of her previous attitude remains. Bellona has retained her capacity for strong emotion and overall passion, but has found herself to become far more cold and calculating than she once was; a flower evolving thorns to protect itself from a cruel world. It isn't very often she is found with true mean or harsh intentions, but follows a path of questionable morals and switches between extremes on seemingly nothing more than a whim. In a way, the Voltolini Matriarch has become more controlled by her emotions than she ever was before the change.
</div>
<div id="tab2">
<h1>History & Lore</h1>
Carlotta was born to Piero and Maria Voltolini in Verona Italy. There were little to no complications despite the ungodly hour she finally began the struggle to make her way out of her mother's body, and a healthy baby girl was given to them. Her father had not set a very healthy scene for his magically inclined offspring, however. He had spent many years pretending to be nothing more than another Italian man, but his last name was an anchor that guaranteed the downfall of his deception. Among Symphony's--the Goddess of Music--Chosen People (the Voltolini Family) natural born females were extremely rare. Baby girls were blessed by the Patron Goddess to be fruitful in labor; it was near impossible for them to experience complications when prengant and giving birth, and having the high pedigree of belonging to a highly established mage family made them desirable among other families. The perfect breeding machines, just at mankind's fingertips!
<br><br>
When news of Carlotta's birth spread like wildfire, it raised a lot of problems for their family. Just because Piero was a pacifistic Faith Mage did not mean the rest of the world would be so kind. 
<img style="height:50%;" align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/xhk0OqV.png"/>
Attacks on his home and attempts to kidnap his daughter were frequent, forcing him to send her to his family's prestigious private tutors as soon as she learned to walk and speak, beginning her on the path to being a full blown Voltolini mage. When she was still very young, her mother birthed another baby girl. Having one daughter in the house was one miracle, but two Voltolini women at once was near unheard of, proving to their family that these girls were their next Speakers, and upping the prices on their heads considerable amounts. Maria did not survive little Nella's birth, and their already reclusive father became even more driven into his own world while he desperately set up a place to send his infant child with the hopes of providing a better life for her. He sacrificed his life to hide her, leaving young Carlotta with no home to return to, and no known siblings to speak of.
<br><br>
She grew just as every Bellona Speaker before her, undergoing intense training specifically designed to model her after the goddess that chose her, molded like clay into an Italian version of the ancient Roman deity so that some day she would be able to channel the goddess' spirit and consciousness; a true living vessel. When she finally had the power to channel Bellona and meld their consciousness, so much time had passed since the once physical entity had access to the physical realm that something in her mentality snapped. She refused to relinquish control of her newfound body, suppressing the girl's true identity behind her own and practically enslaving her. After watching over the girl for so many years it was easy for her to mimic her mannerisms and persona, the only signs of the poor body's owner being so harshly thralled resting in the change of her once-blue-now-blazing-golden eyes and the sudden loss of all magical progress. Surely if Carlotta's teachers were made aware she had lost all of her spells they would grow suspicious, no? Bellona was no fool, she had to find an excuse to get away and regain her strength, sending her hunting for magical academies. Luckily, the forgiving Greater Goddess, Symphony, saw her own Speaker attending one such place and told Bellona of its location but not its occupants, hoping one of her own descendants might talk her out of her current state of full control.

<h1>What is a Speaker?<br><img style="width:40%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/obn2BZt.jpg"/> <img style="width:40%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZCS0g7i.jpg"/></h1>
The Voltolinis as a whole worship and are favored by two goddesses, neither of which are equal in any shape of form. The Primary or "Greater" Goddess is known as Symphony, the Patron Deity of Music who has been a benevolent force for countless centuries. Her counterpart, the Secondary or "Lesser" Goddess is known as Bellona, a newer being who is said to be a minor goddess of music and war. Both are allowed to choose a single female sister at birth to be their Speaker in life, the requirement for the Speakers being sisters often leaving them and the family years at a time without one at all.
<br><br>
A Speaker is raised in an environment that allows them to grow and become a human reflection of the deity that chose them. Their spells, fighting styles, and personalities are supposed to be copies of these deities in order to promote synergy with the idea of fashioning the perfect vessels for their goddesses to be comfortable manifesting within. The higher their synergy, the more of their deity's immeasureable power they can tap into, and the more control the deity has over the body. A Speaker is not designed to be a permanent host, their duty is to lead the family with the wisdom of their deities, who are capable of speaking through their mouths, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears once synergy has been accomplished at least once in their lives. To actually channel their goddess to take physical residence in their body is reserved strictly for emergency situations (like life threatening battles) and in cases of extreme duress.
<br><br>
<h1>Possessed Speaker Racials</h1>
<b>Linked Mind</b><br>
Despite being technically separate entities that exist on entirely different planes, the Speaker and their goddess can always access the senses of the same host body as though both souls are occupying the same space at once. Likewise, they are capable of hearing one another's thoughts and feeling each other's emotions regardless of whom is in control and what their state of control may be. This can often manifest to appear as a multiple personality disorder, but is the result of two separate but entwined entities having access to the same physical form.
<br><br>
<b>Linked Soul</b><br>
Once synergy has officially been achieved, a Speaker and their goddess are confined to each other until the Speaker's death. Unless somehow forcibly removed, the goddess cannot choose a new host, and currently (specifically in Bellona's case) are not capable of manifesting in any shape or form outside of said host until death breaks the chains that tie them together. Manifesting two spirits in one figure does make detection and sensory (for spirit based sensory) require more time and effort to actually gather the proper information said sensory seeks, since the phenomena provides a complicated output of information and often projects a false sense of power above that of the Speaker's real capabilities. The exchange for sensory overload is an increased vulnerability to magic designed to damage the soul specifically; if such an attack connects it will damage both the residents within the host body at once, and do slightly more than what such a spell would usually be capable of.
<br><br>
<b>Linked Energy</b><br>
A Speaker's proficiency with their magical energy depends entirely on how well their body is in tune with the will and nature of their goddess. The more synergized the pair are, the more likely they will experience legitimate magical growth. (Basically just a fancy flavor lore way to explain ranking up.) Discord can lead to loss of focus and interfere with the quality of a spell cast, or even prevent one from being cast at all. On the flipside, the purest synergy will allow them to reach full potential in everything they do as a fused being (still within approved limitations).

<h1>Items</h1>
<b>The Viola</b><br>
Just the typical body of a full sized Stradivarius viola, crafted out of oak. The instrument itself is much older than its owner. Carlotta often carries this object strapped to her back in a fashion akin to a quiver of arrows. 
<br><br>
<h1>Medium</h1>
Not yet accessible.
<br><br>
<h1>Universal Spells (Mana Manipulation)</h1>
<b>Mana Weave</b><br>
The ability to channel mana into the palms of ones hands and their mediums. This is basic mana control and the first spell every mage should learn.
<br><br>
<b>Mana Spark</b><br>
A basic projectile attack created out of the users mana. This is the first offensive spell that a mage will learn.

<h1>Light Radiance (Paige)</h1>
<i>"Someone who works with either the power of extreme light or solid shadows. Both are types of pure energy and are the only substance that can be used. They are more straightforward than elementalists and spells have their basis in malevolence for the dark side or benevolence for the light side. Spells are more powerful in environments that suit their nature and weaker in the opposite. For example, night or being in an inherently evil place may strengthen dark magic and weaken light, while daylight or being in a holy place does the opposite. These powers are often associated with Holy magic and Hell magic."</i>

<h1>Spiritualism (N/A)</h1>
<i>"In this tree, you learn to converse with spirits embodying nature and use them to activate spells. A basic use involves controlling plants, trees and vegetation. You can go so far as to manipulate insects and, in higher levels, the spirits of the elements. A Spiritualist can consult the spirits, heal people using their life force and even control the spirits of time and space in order to alter reality. How ever spiritualists cannot communicate with more than one set of spirits at a time and have a very high cast time because not only do they need time to give their mana to the spirits but also ask the spirits for their help. The only way to be a spiritualist is to have a peaceful heart and a firm resolve for your cause so much that it persuades the other spirits, if there is ever any doubt the spirits will not listen to you."</i>
